## Overview
In these notes a dataset for job postings is extracted, cleaned, and then analyzed quickly as an introduction to the process of data wrangling. The dataset takes the form of a series of job postings with several columns noting values such as the date of the posting, the company, and the job position. The dataset is analyzed using the `numpy` and `pandas` libraries, as well as `matplotlib` for visualizations.

## Requirements
This code depends on the following libraries:
1. `pandas`
2. `numpy`
3. `matplotlib`

In addition to these, the Jupyter Notebook assumes that the data set, which was provided as a zip file, `armenian-online-job-postings.zip`, is in the project folder and, when extracted, provides a file, `online-job-postings.csv'

The Binder badge above can be used to explore an executable environment for this project.
